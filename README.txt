This plugin for the assignment module allows a teacher to annotate and
return PDF files that have been submitted by students.

Teachers can add and position comments and draw lines, ovals and rectangles
onto the student's work, from within the browser, before returning the
work to the student.

This plugin is available in Moodle 2.0-2.2 and Moodle 1.9 versions.
This is the **Moodle 2.0** version - you can download the Moodle 1.9 version
from here:
https://github.com/davosmith/moodle-uploadpdf/zipball/MOODLE_19_STABLE

There is a replacement plugin set for the Moodle 2.3+ assign module, which can be
found here:
https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=assignsubmission_pdf
https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=assignfeedback_pdf

==Installation==

Note: this plugin needs PHP 5.2.0 (or above) for the JSON library.

1. Download and install GhostScript ( http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost )
  - or install from standard respositories, if using Linux.
  Under Windows, do not install to a path with a space in it - that
  means you should install to something like 'c:\gs'
  NOT 'c:\Program Files\gs' (note you only need the files
  'gswin32c.exe' and the dll file from the 'bin' folder, all other
  files are unnecessary for this to work).

2. Unzip the Uploadpdf plugin files to a folder on your local machine

(3.) (Windows server only): Edit the file 'uploadpdf_config.php'  to
  include the path to where you installed GhostScript (see instructions
  in that file for more information)

4. Upload the plugin files to <siteroot>/mod/assignment/type/uploadpdf

5. Log in to Moodle as administrator, then click on 'Notifications'.

All being well, you should now be able to add assignments of type
'uploadpdf' to your courses.

==How to use==

* Add a new activity of the type 'Upload PDF' to a course. (This may
  well show up as '[[typeuploadpdf]]' see 'Known Issues', below).

* Configure all the usual settings - you should be aware of the
  following additions:

  Coversheet - this is a PDF that will be automatically prepended to
  the start of any files submitted by your students

  Template - before submission your students can be (optionally) asked
  to fill in some text fields, the template is used to add these
  entries to the coversheet

  Edit Templates... - see section below

  All files must be PDFs - set to 'No', if you want to collect in some
  supporting documents, which could not be marked as PDFs (e.g. a
  spreadsheet, with formulas you want to check)

  Display checklist (only if the 'checklist' plugin is installed) - you
  can choose to dispaly the progress bar for a checklist after the
  introduction text

  Checklist complete before submission (only if the 'checklist' plugin
  is installed) - you can prevent students from submitting work when
  they have not yet ticked all the items on the checklist


* When a student uploads their files and clicks 'Submit' they will be
  checked to see if they are all PDFs (depending on the setting
  above), before combining them together into a single
  'submission.pdf'.

(Hint: to help students generate PDF files, either use OpenOffice.org
- http://www.openoffice.org - which has PDF export built in, or
install a PDF printer, such as PDF Creator -
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator
Hint2: A copy of PDFTK
Builder - http://angusj.com/pdftk - will help students to combine
their PDF files together in the order they want; my 'uploadpdf' plugin
will just join them in the order they are uploaded).

* The teacher can then log in, go to the usual marking screen (I
  particualarly recommend 'Allow quick grading') and click on
  'Annotate submission', which will bring up the first page of the
  student's work on screen.

* Click anywhere on the image of the PDF to add a comment. Use the
  resize handle in the bottom-right corner of a comment to resize it,
  click & drag on a comment to move it. Click (without dragging) on a
  comment to edit it, delete all the text in a comment to remove it.

* Right-click on a comment to add it to a 'Comment Quicklist'. You can
  then right-click anywhere on a page to insert comments from this
  'Comment Quicklist' (with the same text, width and background as the
  original). Comments can be delete from the 'Comment Quicklist' by
  clicking on the 'X' to the right of the comment.

* You can add lines to the PDF by holding 'Ctrl' ('Alt' on Apple Macs)
  whilst you click and drag with the mouse (or alternatively hold 'Ctrl'
  then click once for the start and once for the end of the line).

* You can also choose different drawing tools by clicking on the icons
  or by using the keys c (comments), l (lines), r (rectangles),
  o (ovals), f (freehand lines), e (erase lines), [ & ] (change comment
  colour), { & } (change line colour)

* Navigate between the pages by clicking on the 'Next' and 'Prev'
  buttons or by pressing 'n' and 'p' on the keyboard.

* Click on 'Save Draft and Close' (or just click on the Window's usual
  'close' button) to save the work in progress.

* Click on the 'Generate Response' icon to create a new PDF with all your
  annotations present (that the student will be able to access).

* You can view the comments you have made on a student's previous
  submissions by choosing that submission from the 'compare to' list

* You can quickly find comments you have previously made by clicking
  on the 'find comment' list.

* Add any feedback / grades to the usual form and save them.

* Note: If you have a problem with the javascript based page navigation
  (added on 22 Nov 2009) or prefer having the list of pages to view,
  then change the setting in 'uploadpdf_config.php'. The  javascript
  method preloads pages to reduce the delay when changing from one page
  to the next (and probably reduces server load if you do a lot of
  switching back and forth between pages). The old navigation is not
  tested regularly and may well break when I make further changes to
  the code.

* Note2: The 'View XX submitted assignments' link has been updated to
  show both the total number of assignments submitted for marking and
  the number still awaiting responses (in brackets). The second number
  is only shown if there are unmarked assignments.

==Edit Templates==

* Click on the 'Edit Templates...' button on the 'Settings' page

* Choose the name of the Template to edit (or select 'New
  Template...')

* You can change the name of the template, delete the template or make
  it available to everyone on the site (administrators only, for this
  last option). Only administrators can edit site templates.
  Note: you cannot delete templates that are in use (click 'show' to
  find out where it is currently being used)

* The list at the bottom allows you to choose an item in the template
  to edit, or choose 'New Item...' to add a new one.

* The types of item you can add are:
  text - a block of text, which will re-flow at 'width' pixels
      'value' will be the prompt the student sees to fill this in
  shorttext - similar to text, but without word-wrapping
      useful for 'name' or 'type your initials to state this is all
      your own work'
  date - fills in the date that the assignment was submitted
      'value' is the format to record the date

* To position the items on the template, upload an example PDF
  coversheet (using the bottom form) then type in the position
  you want to place the PDF (x position, y position, in pixels).
  Alternatively, click on the coversheet image to set the position of
  that template item.

* When you are finished, save any items you have changed, then
  close the window. The list of templates on the 'settings'
  page should have been updated.

==Uninstall==

* Delete any instances of the module from courses.

* Delete the contents of <siteroot>/mod/assignment/type/uploadpdf.

* Use mysql/phpmyadmin to delete the following tables:
  'assignment_uploadpdf', 'assignment_uploadpdf_comment',
  'assignment_uploadpdf_tmpl', 'assignment_uploadpdf_tmplitm',
  'assignment_uploadpdf_qcklist' and 'assignment_uploadpdf_annot'

==Known issues==

There is no way of configuring the GhostScript path via the
Administration menu (this is a Moodle limitation that I have not
yet found a solution to).

There is no way of deleting this from the Administration menu (Moodle
limitiation, again).

There is no way to annotate the PDFs without JavaScript.

The user interface has just had some major changes to it (Apr 2011).
It is possible, despite exentensive testing, that there are some bugs
in it. If you need to, you can get the old version of the user interface
here (install it over the current version):
https://github.com/davosmith/moodle-uploadpdf/zipball/moodle20-originalui

Highlighter tool was (briefly - for about 2 hours, until I realised a better
way of coding it) unable to export highlights properly to the PDF -
this has now been fixed.

==Thanks==
This is heavily based on the 'Advanced Uploading of Files' Assignment
module and makes use of GhostScript and the FPDI and TCPDF libraries
for PDF manipulation; Mootools is used to help with the JavaScript.

Thanks to the creators of all those libraries, as this wouldn't have
been possible without their hard work (and their free software licensing)
